# java-essentials
this is basically a collection of must-knows **(for Java)**. I'll also add other topics like Networking, OS, System Design etc. in different repos. 

*Note:* 
- (Almost) All the examples/best practices are from internet, I will credit them accordingly.  
- All the theoretical stuff (definition/usage) are from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api
